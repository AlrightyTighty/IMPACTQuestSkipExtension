# IMPACTQuestSkipExtension
Browser extension that allows you to skip quests on Code Ninjas Impact.

# How to Install
Either clone the repository or download the source code directly; you need to download the entire folder.

Once the folder is downloaded, install it as a local Chrome extension. I have not paid the $5 fee to upload the plugin to the Chrome extension store, so you will have to re-download this plugin from source every time an update is pushed.
